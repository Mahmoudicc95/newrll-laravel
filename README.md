# Learning Laravel One To One Relationship
* One to one relationship is a very basic type of database relationship. You have one table with primary key that references the id of the other table.

## 1to1 methodes  
* hasOne() method is used to define the 1 to 1 relationship and on another model.
* belongsTo() method to define the inverse relationship.

 ~$ php artisan make:model Identitycard -mc
*  create the passport table migration. To do so run the following command:
  ~$ php artisan make:migration create_passports_table
